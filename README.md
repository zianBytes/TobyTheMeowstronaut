##  Development Journey
Toby began as a 100Ã—100 pixel spaceship sprite drawn in **Pixilart**. From there:
1. Built a **game loop** from scratch in CLion  
2. Created modular classes: `Game`, `Player`, `Obstacle`  
3. Implemented sprite animation and custom obstacle rendering  
4. Added **keyboard input handling** for precise controls  
5. Layered in music & SFX for full immersion  
6. Compiled to **WebAssembly** with Emscripten for browser play
